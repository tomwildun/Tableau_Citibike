# Tableau_Citibike
Module 18 Tableau 

For my analysis I used Jersey City citibike tripdata from: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html 
The files I used were:
JC-202309-citibike-tripdata.csv
JC-202310-citibike-tripdata.csv

I chose these files as they were more recent and were not as large as the New York files for analysis. I chose these files to identify any differences between the two months.

2 Phenomena Analyzed:

1. Analysis of Stations (starting point) with the most Citibike rentals and longest trip duration 

2. Member Status and its effect on the number of trips and trip duration.


Analysis:

1. I first gathered the counts per station name to see what stations had the highest citibike rentals. I determined that the top 2 stations were Grove St PATH and Hoboken Terminal- River St & Hudson Pl. These seem to be the areas with the highest density of rentals as is confirmed on both 'Sept Map Start Station Count' and 'Oct Map Start Station Count'. I used these base maps to show the areas with the most rentals per station. Next, I analyzed the most popular stations by trip duration. It was identified that there was quite a big difference in trip duration between September and October. One possibility for shorter durations could be a decrease in temperature, causing less people to rent citibikes. Further analysis can be conducted on this to determine a correlation.

2. Member status was next analyzed to see if there was an effect on trip duration. It was determined that individuals with a member status on average had shorter trip durations. This could be due to frequent travel to and from work, or it could mean they are more easily accessible for members and they may check in a bike before a casual rider will. Grove St PATH still appears to be the most popular station for both months, however I believe that these popular stations, and trip durations could change depending on the season.
